	<h2>Early Life</h2> 
	<p> 
		Kobe Bryant was born in the year 1978 on August 23 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvannia to Pamela and Joe "Jellybean" Bryant, an NBA player. After retiring from the NBA, Joe decided to take his talents overseas to Italy in 1984, bringing his family with him. While in Italy, Kobe Bryant developed his love for the game of basketball, and his philosophy of thinking. During a film recording with Spike Lee, Kobe noted that "[t]here weren't too many black kids running around in Italy at the time." This lack of familiarity with the area, as well as many other factors that Kobe touched on, forced him into isolation and allowed him to better himself and develop his basketball skills, otherwise known as the "Mamba Mentality".
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Teenage Years</h2>
	<p>
		In 1991, after his father's professional career ended, the Bryant family moved back to America where Kobe would later attend Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania. At first, Bryant struggled heavily with learning English and adapating to a new culture. Facing these obstacles, Kobe used basketball as a tool to communicate to his peers. Quickly rising to stardom on his basketball team, Kobe became a hometown hero, and eventually a national talent. <br> <br>

		During his senior year, Kobe, wearing jersey number #33, led his high school team to a state championship, averaging 30.8 points per game. Kobe also broke the record for most points scored by a Southeastern Pennsylvania High School basketball player with 2,883 points(previously held by Wilt Chamberlin at 2,359 points).   
		<br>
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>The Transition</h2>
	<p>
		After finishing his final high school basketball season, the conversation centered around what Kobe would do next. Kobe had many Division I offers, such as Duke, UNC, and Kansas, to play basketball. However, some argued that he was ready for the professional level. Throughout Kobe's entire senior year, he was very vague on what his decision would be. Towards the end of his season, Kobe revealed in a press conference that he would be taking his talents to the NBA. Although there was celebration in Lower Merion, animosity brewed in other areas. Many NBA analysts, coaches, and general managers stated that they did not want an 18 year old kid amongst their ranks. Facing the adversity, Kobe prepared for the NBA draft in 1996.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>The Draft and First Few Years in the League</h2>
	<p>
		In 1996, on June 26, Kobe Bryant was drafted 13th to the Charlotte Hornets. However, the Los Angeles Lakers traded one of their players, Vlade Divac, to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant. After Draft Night, Kobe was very excited to finally be able to achieve his dream and play an important role on an NBA team. However, for the first few years in the league, Kobe would be forced to sit on the bench with little to no playing time, to no fault of his own. Del Harris, coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, was not a fan of Kobe's "showboat" style of basketball. Evidence to this fact, during practices, Harris would not count Kobe's dunks as points.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		One of the most important moments that help cultivate the "Mamba Mentality" was during Kobe's rookie year in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz. During the final minutes of the game facing elimination, Del Harris, tired of Kobe's attitude, decided to put Kobe Bryant in the game to teach him a lesson. Bryant proceeded to "airball" every shot he took at the end of the game. Although many at the time saw this as a failure, Jerry West, the general manager of the Lakers, stated "If someboy were to shot an airball on our team, and then shot a second one, they would'nt shot a third one. He was fearless... He wasn't going to allow himself to fail."
	</p>

	<p>
		As the years progressed, Harris would be fired in February of 1999. West, when asked why he fired Harris, stated that he felt that the last two games they played have not been acceptable. They felt like there was a deterioration.
	</p>

	<p>
		Later that year, the Lakers would acquire Phil Jackson as their head coach. Many argue that the acquisition of Phil Jackson and his ability to manage the conflicting personalities of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal was the turning point of the Lakers' success.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Kobe, Shaq, and the First Three Championships</h2>
	<p>
		Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant are recognized as one of the greatest duos that played the game of basketball. However, their status and fame were not garnered right away. From 1996, when O'Neal was traded and Bryant was drafted to the Lakers, to 1999, the duo faced tremendous struggle. Whenever the Lakers entered the playoffs, they came up short, and their constant lack of playoff success frustrated Shaquille O'Neal. Much talk surrounded O'Neal's "greatness", and some believed that, despite his incredible stat line, Shaq was no more than a good big man. To add to the fire, Kobe and Shaq's relationship was similar to that of a big brother and a little brother, often arguing and fist-fighting one another. Kobe and Shaq's turmoil fueled them going into the 1999-2000 NBA season, where they proceeded to win their first championship by beating the Indiana Pacers. Their success in the finals continued into a three-peat in the following seasons against the Philadelphia 76ers in 2001 and the New Jersey Nets in 2002. The Lakers' three-peat was a delight to everyone in the organization, especially Kobe and Shaq. But after 2002, their hot streak dwindled as they missed the finals in 2003 and lost to the championship to the Detroit Pistons in 2004. Following their losses, the Lakers agreed to keep Kobe and trade Shaq to the Miami Heat, ending their dynasty.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>The Rebuilding Years</h2>
	<p>	
		Following the loss of Shaquille O'Neal, the next five years would prove difficult for Kobe Bryant. Though he found little to no playoff success, Bryant led the league in scoring from 2005 to 2007, winning league MVP in 2008. Kobe's uncanny ability to score led to a special night against the Toronto Raptors, where he scored 81 points. His outrageous scoring performance that night was the second-most points scored by a player in one game, below Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point performance in 1962. Even with his accolades, Bryant's hunger for a championship was not quenched. To show his determination for winning another championship, Bryant changed his jersey number from #8 to #24. One of the many theories that explained this decision was that there are twenty-four hours in a day, and Bryant wanted to be constantly reminded that he was chasing greatness. In addition to the jersey change, the Lakers acquired a talented center in Pau Gasol. With these changes, it seemed as though Kobe and the Lakers were ready to win another championship in 2008, but they fell short to the Boston Celtics in the finals.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Back to Back Championships</h2>
	<p>
		Following the loss to the Celtics, the Lakers once again made a push to the finals, defeating the Orlando Magic for the championship in 2009. Riding on the momentum of the previous year, the Lakers found themselves in the finals against the team they had lost to in 2008, the Boston Celtics. Although it took seven games, Bryant and the Lakers beat the Celtics, marking Kobe's fifth championship with the Lakers. When asked about how much the win meant to him, Kobe responded with, "I just got one more than Shaq" (referring to having won one more championship than Shaquille O'Neal in his career).
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Final Years and Passing</h2>
	<p>
		After playing another five years of basketball, Kobe decided to declare retirement in the 2015-16 NBA season, ending his career on a historic night. Many were excited to see what Bryant would do in his final game, and he failed to disappoint. On April 13th, 2016, at the age of 37, Kobe scored 60 points, setting a record for the most points scored in a player's final game, and leading the Lakers to a victory against the Utah Jazz. Following his retirement, Kobe continued to improve himself in avenues other than basketball, winning an Oscar for his animated short film "Dear Basketball" in 2018. Suddenly, Kobe Bryant's life was cut short on January 26th, 2020 when he and eight other people, including his daughter Gianna Bryant, died in a helicopter crash over Calabasas, California. Bryant was fourty-one and his daughter Gianna was thirteen.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Final Remarks</h2>
	<p>
		Following Bryant's death, the world lamented his passing. Many stories and praises from his past teammates, friends, and family members rose following the tragedy. Their eulogies vastly contrasted from his reputation as a player in the NBA. Though hatred surrounded Bryant during his time in the league, it was clear after his death the impact he had on the world. In tribute to Bryant, many players changed their jersey numbers to that of Bryant's, and the NBA renamed the All-Star Game MVP award to be the Kobe Bryant MVP award. Regardless of the image Kobe Bryant had created for himself in the league, it is undeniable that his impact on the NBA and the world will be remembered for decades to come.

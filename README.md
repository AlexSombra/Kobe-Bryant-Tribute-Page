# Name 
Kobe Bryant Tribute Page
# Description
This web page not only provides a basic overview on the life of Kobe Bryant, but also provides special information on his life that
many do not know
# Purpose
This webpage was created as a challenge during Quarantine of 2020. I wanted to see if I could teach myself HTML and CSS, while also 
creating something all within one summer.
# Extra Info
In this page, I use an image that is originally owned by another source. If you click the picture, of Kobe Bryant, 
you can visit the source of the image. I also cite the image at the end of the page in the "Sources Column". If you are the owner 
of this image and would like me to take this down, feel free to email me here: Alexander_Vasquez@student.uml.edu
